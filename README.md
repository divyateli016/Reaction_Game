Reaction Game – Real-Time Embedded Application (ERIKA OS)
This project was developed as part of an Embedded Operating Systems course using the ERIKA real-time OS. It is designed to measure a user’s reaction time based on a random number displayed on a seven-segment display. The user must press the correct button in response; otherwise, a timeout is triggered. Additionally, a parallel LED fader runs concurrently to enhance the visual experience.

Key features implemented:
	•	Parallel task execution using ERIKA’s real-time kernel
	•	Interrupt-driven input handling
	•	Event management and flat state machine design
	•	Hands-on experience with real-time constraints and embedded hardware
